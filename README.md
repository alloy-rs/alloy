# Alloy

Alloy connects applications to blockchains.

Alloy is a rewrite of [`ethers-rs`] from the ground up, with exciting new
features, high performance, and excellent docs.

[`ethers-rs`] will continue to be maintained until we have achieved
feature-parity in Alloy. No action is currently needed from devs.

## Supported Rust Versions

<!--
When updating this, also update:
- .clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
-->

Alloy will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.76.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release.

## Contributing

Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have you! We have
[a contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to help you get involved in the
Alloy project.

Pull requests will not be merged unless CI passes, so please ensure that your
contribution follows the linting rules and passes clippy.

## Note on `no_std`

Because these crates are primarily json-rpc focused, we do not intend to support
`no_std` for most of them at this time. 
The following crates support `no_std`:
- alloy-eips
- alloy-genesis
- alloy-serde

- [`ruint`](https://github.com/recmo/uint)
