## Overview

PubSub services, unlike regular RPC services, are long-lived and
bidirectional. They are used to subscribe to events on the server, and
receive notifications when those events occur.

The PubSub system here consists of 3 logical parts:
- The **frontend** is the part of the system that the user interacts with.
  It exposes a simple API that allows the user to issue requests and manage
  subscriptions.
- The **service** is an intermediate layer that manages request/response
  mappings, subscription aliasing, and backend lifecycle events. Running
  [`PubSubConnect::into_service`] will spawn a long-lived service task.
- The **backend** is an actively running connection to the server. Users
  should NEVER instantiate a backend directly. Instead, they should use
  [`PubSubConnect::into_service`] for some connection object.

This crate provides the following:

- [PubSubConnect]: A trait for instantiating a PubSub service by connecting
  to some **backend**. Implementors of this trait are responsible for
  the precise connection details, and for spawning the **backend** task.
  Users should ALWAYS call [`PubSubConnect::into_service`] to get a running
  service with a running backend.
- [`ConnectionHandle`]: A handle to a running **backend**. This type is
  returned by [PubSubConnect::connect], and owned by the **service**.
  Dropping the handle will shut down the **backend**.
- [`ConnectionInterface`]: The reciprocal of [ConnectionHandle]. This type
  is owned by the **backend**, and is used to communicate with the
  **service**. Dropping the interface will notify the **service** of a
  terminal error.
- [`PubSubFrontend`]: The **frontend**. A handle to a running PubSub
  **service**. It is used to issue requests and subscription lifecycle
  instructions to the **service**.
